# Battleship

A game developed between the 4th and 5th week of <AC_> 64th bootcamp (LOOPeytunes), after less than 3 weeks learning Java. 

Concepts learned until now:

Basic Java
Java Build Process
Basic OOP
Composition
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Interfaces
Simple Graphics Library
Containers
Nested Classes


## The idea

Our project was based on the naval battle, with a mix of looney tunes characters. 

In this game, initially the player and the PC set their game pieces. After this, they take turns and whoever destroys all their pieces first wins.

To play this game, the pieces move as follows:

 * A key to move left;

 * W key to move up;

 * D key to move right;

 * S key to move down;

 * Space key to select target.


## Development

We were given the project's approval at Monday in week 4. We developed an UML diagram and divided the group in two teams:

 * The first team was responsible for creating the game field, the game class and the NPC class (responsible for the way the NPC behaves).

 * The second team was responsible for the pieces movements by the player.
